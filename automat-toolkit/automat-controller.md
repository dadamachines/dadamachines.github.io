## Input
- **DC Powered** – Power Supply 9V-24V – DC Barrel Plug 2.5 x 5.5mm Center Positive – 8A max current (protected by 5x20mm Cartridge Fuse (Feinsicherung)).
- The Power Supply coming with the automat toolkit has 24V – 160W – 6.6A (first batch of toolkits) or 24V – 120W – 5.0A (current batches of toolkits).
- **USB Powered** – only for development / hacking without Actuators connected.


## Output
- Each DC Output Channel is limited to 1.4A current
- DC Outputs are always the same voltage you feed the automat (default 24V / allowed range 9-24V).
- The Output Connections are 2.1 x 5.5mm DC Jacks – Center Positive (9-24V on Center Pin)
- The switching Transistor / MOSFETs for the Outputs are protected (Overload protection, Short circuit protection, Overvoltage protection, Current limitation and Thermal shutdown with auto restart)
- Each Output has a Flyback Diode for protection against inductive loads
