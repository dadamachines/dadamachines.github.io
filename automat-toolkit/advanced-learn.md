1. Press the LEARN Button **twice**.
2. Send a MIDI note from your Keyboard, Sequencer, Computer. The advanced LEARN mode will assign 12 Notes you send after pressing the LEARN Button twice to the 12 Outputs of the automat controller.
This way you can assign individual notes to each Output.

> Please connect the [Power Supply](/docs/automat-toolkit/power-supply) first. If you did not get one you can only continue via USB but not drive any motors with the outputs.
