Hey,\
it looks like you just got your dadamachines â€“ automat board / controller / toolkit!\
\
Here I will explain how to get started with your hardware.

{: .highlight }
After opening your package. The first thing you can do is to [configure](https://automat-configurator.dadamachines.com/) the MIDI connection of the automat either via **DIN MIDI** or **USB**. 
There is also the [Simple LEARN](https://docs.dadamachines.com/automat-toolkit/automat-controller/simple-learn/) and [Advanced LEARN](https://docs.dadamachines.com/automat-toolkit/automat-controller/advanced-learn/) mode to configure your **automat controller**.

{: .important }
> Please connect the [Power Supply](/docs/automat-toolkit/power-supply) first. If you did not get one you can only continue via USB but not drive any motors with the outputs.
