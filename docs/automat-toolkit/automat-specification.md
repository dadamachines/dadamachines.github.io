{: .no_toc }

## Input
- USB Powered – only for development / hacking without Actuators connected.
- DC Powered – Power Supply 9V-24V – DC Barrel Plug 2.5 x 5.5mm Center Positive – 8A max current (protected by 5x20mm Cartridge Fuse (Feinsicherung)
- The Power Supply coming with the automat toolkit has 24V – 160W – 6.6A

## Output
- Each DC Output Channel is limited to 1.4A current
- DC Outputs are always the same voltage you feed the automat
- The Output Connections are 2.1 x 5.5mm DC Jacks – Center Positive (9-24V on Center Pin)
- The switching Transistor / MOSFETs for the Outputs are protected (Overload protection, Short circuit protection, Overvoltage protection, Current limitation and Thermal shutdown with auto restart)
- Each Output has a Flyback Diode for protection against inductive loads
