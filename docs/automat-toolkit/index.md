# Get started

Hey,
it looks like you just got your dadamachines â€“ automat board / controller / toolkit!

## Here I will explain how to get started with your hardware.
- After opening your package. The first thing you can do is to configure the MIDI connection of the automat either via DIN MIDI or USB.
- [Please connect the Power Supply first, If you did not get one you can only continue via USB but not drive any motors with the outputs]

## How to configure the DC Outputs of the automat?
Follow the QuickStart Guide which should be coming with your unit, or continue reading here.

1. Connect the automat.
2. Press the LEARN Button [IMPORTANT: The most right one on the backside of the automat] once.
3. Send a MIDI note from your Keyboard, Sequencer, Computer.
>> The first output should now always be triggered by the MIDI note you send.
